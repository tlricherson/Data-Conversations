# What a *data story* is and is not #

The traditional *data wall* in a school or classroom may represent one type of story. But what are the attributes that identify it as one? How is a story using data similar to or different from traditional narratives?

## Bunny trails ##
Last year, we started building and sharing a new type of data wall in our district---one which was designed to encourage a broader conversation. Learn more about our [district data stories](https://www.tumwater.k12.wa.us/Page/7852).

Stories can take many formats. Have you ever tried to imagine how a fish soup tastes whose recipe is based on publicly available local fishing data? Or what a pizza would be like if it was based on Helsinki’s population mix? [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net/), led by [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner), explores food as a means of data expression - or, if you like – edible diagrams.
