# What a *data story* is and is not #

The typical *data wall* in a school or classroom may represent one type of story. But what are the attributes that identify it as one? How is a story using data similar to or different from traditional narratives? 

## Traditional data walls ##
[Data walls](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23datawall&src=typd) and [data binders](https://twitter.com/search?q=data%20binder&src=typd) are two of the most common types of semi-public data displays. There are entire [district cultures devoted to using these](http://qualitycommunityschools.weebly.com/data-walls.html), as well as a network of resources through the [sharing economy of blogs](http://www.thecurriculumcorner.com/thecurriculumcorner123/2014/07/student-data-binder/) and sources like Teacher Pay Teachers. 

Some classroom teachers take this a step further and have students track and use their own data. There are references to this in our instructional frameworks; however, student-involved data use is a relatively new area of educational research. A selection of articles is included in the literature review section of this page. 

Can a traditional data wall also be a data story? It's possible, but many do not take this path. What is the difference...and why should we care?

## Data stories ##
Last year, we started building and sharing a new type of data wall in our district---one which was designed to encourage a broader conversation. Learn more about our [district data stories](https://www.tumwater.k12.wa.us/Page/7852).

### Examples ###
Data stories can take many formats. Here are some online examples that may encourage you to think about presenting data differently.
* Visit an [interactive and geographical version](https://1812.tass.ru/en#) of [Minard's famous map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard) about Napoleon's march on Russia in 1812.
* Take a look at this [introduction to hierarchical models](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/) from UW.
* [Kim Rees](https://twitter.com/krees) at Periscopic led this project on visualizing [gun deaths in terms of the number of years of lives stolen](http://guns.periscopic.com/). While not an official data story, her project on [touching data](http://www.periscopic.com/news/touching-data) is also well worth consideration.
* On Quartz, they look at the fact that [most women are reading self-help books by men](https://qz.com/1106341/most-women-reading-self-help-books-are-getting-advice-from-men/) and why this matters.
* Visit [Rock 'n Poll](http://rocknpoll.graphics/) to learn more about why polling results should be taken with a grain of salt.
* Stories can take many formats. Have you ever tried to imagine how a fish soup tastes whose recipe is based on publicly available local fishing data? Or what a pizza would be like if it was based on Helsinki’s population mix? [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net/), led by [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner), explores food as a means of data expression - or, if you like – edible diagrams.

### Background ###
[Jon Schwabish](https://twitter.com/jschwabish) has posted a [collection of blog posts, books, and other resources](https://policyviz.com/2017/03/24/more-story-references-and-resources/) on storytelling with data.
