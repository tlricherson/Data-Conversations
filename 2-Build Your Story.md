# What are the *tools* and *strategies* for building a data story? #

So, you're ready to build a data story. Now that you have your idea (and a wall or other space for the display), how do you get started? And what do you do if you get stuck?

## Inspiration ##
Check out [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), "a year-long, analog data drawing project by [Giorgia Lupi](https://twitter.com/giorgialupi) and [Stefanie Posavec](https://twitter.com/stefpos), two award-winning information designers living on different sides of the Atlantic. By collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends."

Visit the Pinterest sites of [Jon Schwabish](https://www.pinterest.com/jonschwabish/) or [Lynn Cherny](https://www.pinterest.com/arnicas/) for tagged collections of charts (good, bad, and ugly), design items, and more.

[Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi) has an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/monachalabi/) feed of her hand drawn charts on a variety of topics. Also, have a look the work of [Catherine Madden](https://twitter.com/catmule) who integrates data, design, and drawing.

## Tools and strategies ##
* There are any number of collections of data viz options. For chart ideas, take a look at the [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com), [The Chartmaker Directory](http://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/), or [The Data Visualization Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/).

## Behind the scenes ##
Sometimes, as data designers, you have to [kill your darlings](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/18/_kill_your_darlings_writing_advice_what_writer_really_said_to_murder_your.html), or as Dan Greenberg said, "Marry the problem, not the solution." However, there is much to be learned from sharing the process that leads to the final story. Here are a few examples:
* [Nicholas Rougeux](https://twitter.com/rougeux) has shared not only the process he used to create [visualizations of classical music](https://www.c82.net/blog/?id=72), but also many of the various iterations of ideas he had. 
* Eleanor Lutz gives a [tour of the rough drafts and sketches](http://tabletopwhale.com/2016/10/20/rough-drafts-and-sketches.html) behind her infographic on [heartbeats and heart attacks](http://tabletopwhale.com/2016/10/19/heartbeats-and-heart-attacks.html).

## Build more background knowledge ##
ProPublica has shared all of materials from their [Data Institute](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/announcing-free-videos-and-training-materials-from-the-propublica-data-institute). You can access slides, handouts, and videos of the work they do with journalists to present data on the web.

[Enrico Bertini](https://twitter.com/FILWD) posts all of his NYU [course materials on information visualization](http://enrico.bertini.io/teaching/), as does [Nick Sousanis](https://twitter.com/Nsousanis) for his classes on [comics as a way of thinking](http://spinweaveandcut.com/comics-as-thinking-15/).
