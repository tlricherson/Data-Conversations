## Who gets to be the *storyteller* and what are their *responsibilities*? ##

To tell a data story, one must have access to the data, tools, and skills necessary to share the information. These limitations are not the only ones which can have an impact. Every decision--from data set, to chart type, to design, to where the story is shared---can affect the ability of an audience to engage with the conversation. Audiences are not a one-size-fits-all crowd, either. 

How do we increase equity with our data conversations? What are our powers and responsibilities to make that happen?
